    The control logic watches the input signal and finds excursions above

    When recording starts, the beep_on sound is enqueued for playback.

    During recording recording_timeout is > 0 and reset to its maximum whenever
    audio above the threshold value is detected during recording. So the
    recording continues until no signal is detected anymore.

    While record_holdoff is > 0 the input signal does not influece the
    threshold detection. This is done because when the the beep_off sound is
    played after the message is recorded, its echo in the line should not
    reenable recording.
